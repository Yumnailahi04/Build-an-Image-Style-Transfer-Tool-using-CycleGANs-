# Build an Image Style Transfer Tool using CycleGANs  🤗🤗🤗
#### Image Style Transfer Tool is a tool or software that allows users to transfer style or visual characteristics from one image to another.
#### CycleGANs are an abbreviation for "Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks". It is a type of generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture developed for performing domain transfer tasks without requiring corresponding pairs of training data. 
#### The main difference between CycleGANs and traditional GANs is the use of the "cyclical consistency" concept. This means that instead of just mapping directly from one domain to another, CycleGANs learn the mapping from one domain to another and then back. For example, if we have two image domains such as horses and zebras, CycleGANs not only learn to transform horse images into zebras, but also learn to revert the zebra images back to horse images.
#### This project aims to instruct and guide us through the implementation of Building an Image Style Transfer Tool using CycleGANs.
